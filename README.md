# AMR Final Project: 2-Wheel Differential Drive Robot

## Project Summary

This project presents the complete **modeling, control, and motion planning** of a **two‑wheeled differential drive mobile robot** equipped with **two actuated drive wheels**. The objective is to demonstrate how kinematic and dynamic models, feedback control, and motion planning algorithms can be integrated to achieve **stable trajectory tracking and reliable obstacle avoidance** in a planar environment.

The system is implemented and validated through Python-based simulations and animations.

## 1. System Modeling

### Kinematic Modeling                                                                        

* Derived the **forward and inverse kinematics** of a differential drive robot              
* Related individual wheel velocities to the robot’s linear and angular motion                
* Modeled the robot as a **non‑holonomic system** operating in 2D space                       


### Dynamic Modeling

 * Implemented simplified **wheel and motor dynamics**
 * Included actuator dynamics to capture realistic velocity tracking behavior
 * Integrated the dynamic model with kinematics for closed-loop simulation
     

### Physical Principles and Implementation

* Independent wheel actuation generates both translation and rotation
* All models are implemented in **Python** and validated via simulations/plots

## 2. Control Methodology

### Control Strategy

* Designed **SMC Controllers** for individual wheel velocity control
* Used inverse kinematics to map desired linear and angular velocities to wheel commands
* Achieved smooth motion for both straight-line and curved trajectories

### Stability Considerations

* Analyzed closed-loop behavior using velocity error dynamics
* Demonstrated **stability** under SMC
* Ensured bounded tracking errors under realistic actuator limits

### Testing and Validation

* **Straight-line motion:** constant linear velocity with zero angular velocity
* **Circular motion:** constant linear and angular velocities
* Performance validated using trajectory tracking plots and animations

## 3. Motion Planning and Obstacle Avoidance

### Planning Approach

* Implemented **artificial potential field–based motion planning**
* Combined attractive forces toward the goal with repulsive forces from obstacles, pedestrians, walls
* Able to predict the possible path/trajectory of the robot from start to goal adn then improvise

### Obstacle Avoidance

* Modeled obstacles using inflated safety (no‑go) zones
* Enabled collision-free navigation around multiple moving or static obstacles
* Ensured compatibility with differential drive non‑holonomic constraints

### Key Characteristics

* Reactive, real-time planning
* Smooth and continuous trajectories
* Seamless integration with low-level control

## Results

* Successful navigation from start to goal locations
* Stable straight-line and circular trajectory tracking
* Reliable obstacle avoidance in environments with multiple moving/static obstacles
* Animations confirm smooth motion, stable control, and goal convergence

## Repository Structure

* **All_HW/**

  *Contains several files related to every step progressed of the project one by one. Starting from Kinematics, Dynamics to finally able to
  implement SMC, APF and CBF with animated simulations.
  [SMC: Sliding Modular Controller   APF: Artificial Potential Fields  CBF: Control Barrier Function]


* **media_files/**
  This folder contains all the media files related to the project which includes simulation videos and phase potrait plots which is getting
  generated by the .csv file from ALL_HW folder


* **AMR_Final_Project_Devank.py**

  *Final project file with full animated simulation and HUD for user inputs.
  Select (by clicking) any part on the screen as starting point and then click again to set Goal point. The robot will automatically start moving towards the goal
  and avoiding the moving pedestrians & static obstacles. By clicking restart the arena will reset again and the obstacles,pedestrians will be positioned randomly.


All the files named AMR_HW... have simulations for:
*Straight-line motion simulation of a 2-wheeled differential drive robot

*Circular motion simulation of a 2-wheeled differential drive robot

*Motion planning and obstacle avoidance simulations using Artificial Potential Fields, Control Barrier Function.
Demonstrates navigation around various obstacles static/moving with safety zones and animation.

## Setup and Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once dependencies are installed, each script can be executed independently to reproduce the corresponding simulations and animations.
